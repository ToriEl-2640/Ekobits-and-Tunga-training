A fast-forward merge is when Git can easily tell when commit happened while a recursive merge is introduced when two commits are made on different branches at different times making it difficult for Git to tell what order the commits were made.

5.
  The git checkout command with the name of specified branch is used to change to another branch.

6.
Use git checkout --NAME_OF_FILE to remove modified or deleted files from the working directory.

7.
To delete a branch, run git branch -D NAME_OF_BRANCH

8.
git diff command shows changes in the working tree not yet staged for the next commit.

9.
Use git rm --cached NAME_OF_FILE to remove files from the staging area.

10.
 Merge conflicts occurs when changes on two commits cannot be resoloved automatically by git as they conflict on which code to be kept or discarded.
